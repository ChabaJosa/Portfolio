              <p>
                Ironhack graduate from January 2020, full-stack web development
                cohort with a +2 year background in software development and
                a +3 year background digital media. My current aspirations are
                to grow within the tech industry while continuing to learn about
                programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                My education started in my home country of Venezuela and
                continued in the College of Southern Maryland where I completed
                college in 3 semesters and a summer, while working remotely for
                the first company I worked for, MT Group. I went on to study
                marketing at Florida International University and started my
                Social Media Marketing career at Radar.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once I realized my true passion was coding, I ceased attending
                undergraduate classes with only a semester shy of graduating to
                study computer programming on my own. While I put in a couple of
                hours a day, I knew I wasn't doing enough to reach the
                professional level of expertise I was looking for. That is when I
                found the Ironhack coding school Full-Stack Web Development
                Bootcamp. With 500+ hours of hands-on programming, I knew
                Ironhack would provide me the tools I was looking for.
                <br />
                <br />I completed the Bootcamp in 9 weeks, while still working
                full-time at Radar and delivering exponential results of organic
                growth. My team won best final project for our App that used
                machine learning and web scraping to help plan out social media
                content strategies.
                <br />
                <br />
                I applied my newly acquired skills at Radar for a while, but I was
                still having to do social media and digital marketing related tasks.
                I was ready for a 100 percent software development job and I found
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://www.banyanair.com/'>Banyan</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                I started as an ile RPG Developer and as such, developed end-of-month reports for accounting,
                web programs for technicians to look up available parts and inventory for aircrafts. After a few
                months, I noticed there was a huge opportunity cost. While most employees are out in the tarmac, they
                have no access to any program unless they are sitting at their desktop, so I convinced the
                Director of Application Development to let me create proof of concept for a mobile app using a REST API
                and a React-Native frontend. After a month, I had a prototype working and searching for parts!
                This shifted our focus for the entire 2021 year towards building a multi-faceted mobile app for both
                employees and customers of Banyan Air Services and we succeeded in doing so! This will be the first
                project listed below!
                <br />
                <br />
                This experience has made me realize that I want to focus on mobile development in the next few years
                of my career at infosec. I am looking forward to learning other mobile technologies like Flutter, Swift,
                and Kotlin.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you have made it this far, thank you for reading my story!
